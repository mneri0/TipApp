## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is complete:

* [x] User can enter a bill amount, choose a tip percentage, and see the tip and total values.
* [x] User can select between tip percentages by tapping different values on the segmented control and the tip value is updated accordingly

The following **optional** features are implemented:

* [ ] UI animations
* [ ] Remembering the bill amount across app restarts (if <10mins)
* [ ] Using locale-specific currency and currency thousands separators.
* [x] Making sure the keyboard is always visible and the bill amount is always the first responder. This way the user doesn't have to tap anywhere to use this app. Just launch the app and start typing.

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [x] Settings view/screen 
- [x] Optional dark mode toggle

## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app: 

Xcode was a new technology and required me to get used to iOS development since I have more experience with Windows and Linux platforms. 
Reading over Apple documentation was a bit difficult since there were not many examples on there to follow or replicate. 
Everything else was a new learning experience.
